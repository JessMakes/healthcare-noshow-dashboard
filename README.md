Reducing Missed Appointments: Who Misses, Why, and How to Improve

Project Summary:
This project analyzes 428,000 patient appointments from a real-world healthcare dataset to uncover patterns behind missed appointments (no-shows). The interactive Power BI dashboard explores trends across age, gender, medical conditions, and the effectiveness of SMS reminders. The goal is to support data-driven decisions that improve patient attendance, optimize scheduling, and enhance operational efficiency.

Dashboard Highlights

1. Total Appointments Scheduled

Total Volume: 427,950 appointments.
Even small improvements in show-up rate can lead to large operational gains.

2. No-Show Rate by Age Band
Highest no-shows: 41–65 and 18–40 age groups.

Recommendation: Prioritize reminders and flexible scheduling for working-age adults.

3. Attendance by Chronic Condition
Higher attendance: Hypertension, diabetes.
Lower attendance: Alcoholism, handicap.

Recommendation: Provide additional support or follow-up for vulnerable groups.

4. Gender-Based Attendance
Insight: Women showed up more often than men.

Recommendation: Explore possible barriers men face and adjust outreach strategies.

5. SMS Reminder Effectiveness
No-shows with SMS: 38,272
No-shows without SMS: 48,448

Recommendation: SMS reminders help but aren’t a silver bullet. Combine with personalized follow-up.

6. SMS Distribution by Age Group
Most SMS sent: 41–65 and 18–40
Insight: Despite high SMS volume, no-show rates remain high for these groups.

Recommendation: Experiment with SMS tone, timing, and frequency.

7. No-Show Flag Summary
Overall no-shows: 86,720 (~20%)
Opportunity: Reducing no-shows by even 5% can free up over 21,000 appointments/year.

 Business Impact
